### Video to PDF
- run `extract_frames.py` (change video name and set desired frame skip)
- delete duplicate and invalid images (didn't make a program, didn't really have to)
- run `extract_pages.py` (in case you need to crop specific part of image (set coordinates))
- run `split_pages.py` (in my case 2 pages were present on each image so I had to split it in half (at the specific width))
- run `create_pdf.py`
- enjoy stolen book :D
